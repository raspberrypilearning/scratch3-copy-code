You can copy code from one sprite to another sprite in the Sprite list:

![Drag code from one sprite to another sprite, then let go of the code.](images/drag-parrot-code.gif)

Both sprites will have the code blocks that you have copied. You can delete the code from the first sprite if you want to move the code.
